develop a chatbot that does the basic calculation, this chatbot aimed to helps users do basic mathematical operations by taking a string as input and then decodes the basic mathematical operations mainly (+ , -, square root, *, ...etc), the solution converts a user input (string) to mathematical operations and digits. 

you should create a unique id for the session and store the following in the database:  

1- the string request from the user (for example: please add 5 to 9). 

2- the mathematical form of the user request (for example 5 + 9 ). 

3- the final result (for example 14). 

 

you should ask the user if he/she needs to make another calculation. 

all processes will be related to the session ID in the database.
